# ParamStore

This gem goal is to <strike>DRY some code I have been copying around for a while</strike> make easy switching in between ENV and [AWS Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html) for retrieving parameters.

This gem is not a replacement for [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv). I still use and recommend it in development, in case it is "safe" to save your keys in `.env` files, otherwise, you could also use AWS Parameter Store for development.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'param_store'
```

## Usage

For switching in between ENV and AWS Parameter Store, you need you set which adapter you want to use.

```ruby
# read from AWS Parameter Store
# i.e. config/environments/production.rb
ParamStore.adapter = :aws_parameter_store
# default path for AWS Parameter Store Hierarchies
# see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-su-organize.html
ParamStore.path = '/Environment/Type of computer/Application'

# read from ENV
# i.e. config/environments/[development, test].rb
ParamStore.adapter = :env
```

For retrieving parameters:

```ruby
# fetch is similar to Hash#fetch,
# if the key is not found and there's no default defined, it raises an error
ParamStore.fetch(:my_secret_key)
```

You can also make the AWS Parameter Store compatible with `ENV` by copying params to `ENV`.

```ruby
# i.e. config/application.rb
# Bundler.require(*Rails.groups)
ParamStore.copy_to_env(keys: %i[key1 key2 key3])

ENV[:key1] # => value for key1
ENV[:key2] # => value for key2
ENV[:key3] # => value for key3
```

### Fail-fast

You can also configure what are the required parameters for an app and fail at boot-time:

```ruby
# i.e. config/application.rb
# Bundler.require(*Rails.groups)
ParamStore.require!(keys: %i[key1 key2 key3])
```

#### aws ssm

A few useful [aws ssm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/index.html) commands:

```sh
aws ssm get-parameters-by-path --path /Prod/ERP/SAP --with-decryption
aws ssm put-parameter --name /Prod/ERP/SAP --value ... --type SecureString
```


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
